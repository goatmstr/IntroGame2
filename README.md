So I added a theme which is soccer and it shows the paddles as Messi and Ronaldo. Everything works fine but for some reason theres a glitch 
where if I add the player sprites, the ball only shows up like 20% of the time. I'm not sure if thats just on my end but just to be safe, I
commented out the sprites. If you want to see the sprites uncomment lines 141-143.
